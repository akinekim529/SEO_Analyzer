## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the Ultimate SEO Analysis Tool seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them by:

1. **Creating a private security advisory** on GitHub:
   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/yourusername/ultimate-seo-analyzer/security)
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the form with details

2. **Email** (if GitHub security advisories are not available):
   - Send details to: security@yourproject.com
   - Include "SECURITY" in the subject line

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths** of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- **Location** of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact** of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving your report
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days with a more detailed response
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical issues within 30 days

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report
2. **Investigation**: We'll investigate and validate the reported vulnerability
3. **Fix Development**: We'll develop and test a fix for confirmed vulnerabilities
4. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We'll work with you on timing for public disclosure
5. **Credit**: We'll credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

When using the Ultimate SEO Analysis Tool:

1. **API Keys**: 
   - Store OpenAI API keys securely in `.env` files
   - Never commit API keys to version control
   - Use environment variables in production

2. **Network Security**:
   - Use HTTPS URLs when possible
   - Be cautious when analyzing untrusted websites
   - Consider using VPNs or proxies for sensitive analysis

3. **Data Privacy**:
   - Be aware that analyzed data may be sent to OpenAI's API
   - Review OpenAI's privacy policy for data handling
   - Avoid analyzing sensitive or private websites

4. **System Security**:
   - Keep Python and dependencies updated
   - Run the tool in isolated environments when possible
   - Regularly update the tool to get security patches

### For Developers

When contributing to the project:

1. **Dependencies**:
   - Regularly audit and update dependencies
   - Use `pip-audit` or similar tools to check for vulnerabilities
   - Pin dependency versions in `requirements.txt`

2. **Code Security**:
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use secure HTTP libraries and settings
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Avoid executing user-provided code

3. **API Security**:
   - Implement rate limiting for API calls
   - Use secure methods for API key storage
   - Validate API responses before processing

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Web Scraping**: The tool makes HTTP requests to external websites, which could potentially expose your IP address
2. **OpenAI API**: Analysis data is sent to OpenAI's servers for processing
3. **Local File Generation**: HTML reports are generated locally and could contain user data

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Proxy Support**: Consider using proxies for web requests
2. **Data Sanitization**: User inputs are validated and sanitized
3. **Secure Defaults**: The tool uses secure default configurations
4. **Minimal Permissions**: The tool requires minimal system permissions

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:

- Released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2)
- Documented in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
- Announced in GitHub releases
- Tagged with security labels

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Reporting**: Security issues should be reported privately first
2. **Coordinated Timeline**: We work with reporters on disclosure timing
3. **Public Disclosure**: After fixes are released, we publish security advisories
4. **Credit**: We acknowledge security researchers who help improve our security
